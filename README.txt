hello this is YOHOSHIVA 
hope you are  doing fine

let's do some social media mining form Twitter 

Download code file in the Repository 

we extract tweets from a Twitter account and do some classification using logistic regression.
take one Twitter account and make sure your account has permission from Twitter to extract Tweets from your account.
if you don't have access go and apply for twitter API keys 
go to this link below and apply for it 
https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access 

after getting access 
go to http://apps.twitter.com -> Details->Keys and tokens->
find keys mention below 
Consumer API keys 
Access token & access token secret
In that, we have two keys for Consumer API keys and two keys for Access token & access token secret for each account it is different.
At the same time if we want new keys click Regenerate it create updated keys  for both Consumer API, keys Access token & access token secret
copy the keys and past it in our code file and run the code setp by step.
 
NOTE:

we use the pickle file to fast processing.if any .pickle file is not there go my previous Repository and Execute that Repository you get all pickle files

we use TF-IDF ( Term frequency-inverse document frequency) model to convert our text to numerical data after we use the numerical data set for the logistic model.
